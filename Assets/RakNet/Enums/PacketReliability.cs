public enum PacketReliability
{
	/// Same as regular UDP, except that it will also discard duplicate datagrams.  RakNet adds (6 to 17) + 21 bits of overhead, 16 of which is used to detect duplicate packets and 6 to 17 of which is used for message length.
	UNRELIABLE,

	/// Regular UDP with a sequence counter.  Out of order messages will be discarded.
	/// Sequenced and ordered messages sent on the same channel will arrive in the order sent.
	UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED,

	/// The message is sent reliably, but not necessarily in any order.  Same overhead as UNRELIABLE.
	RELIABLE,

	/// This message is reliable and will arrive in the order you sent it.  Messages will be delayed while waiting for out of order messages.  Same overhead as UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED.
	/// Sequenced and ordered messages sent on the same channel will arrive in the order sent.
	RELIABLE_ORDERED,

	/// This message is reliable and will arrive in the sequence you sent it.  Out or order messages will be dropped.  Same overhead as UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED.
	/// Sequenced and ordered messages sent on the same channel will arrive in the order sent.
	RELIABLE_SEQUENCED,

	/// Same as UNRELIABLE, however the user will get either ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED or ID_SND_RECEIPT_LOSS based on the result of sending this message when calling RakPeerInterface::Receive(). Bytes 1-4 will contain the number returned from the Send() function. On disconnect or shutdown, all messages not previously acked should be considered lost.
	UNRELIABLE_WITH_ACK_RECEIPT,

	/// Same as UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED, however the user will get either ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED or ID_SND_RECEIPT_LOSS based on the result of sending this message when calling RakPeerInterface::Receive(). Bytes 1-4 will contain the number returned from the Send() function. On disconnect or shutdown, all messages not previously acked should be considered lost.
	/// 05/04/10 You can't have sequenced and ack receipts, because you don't know if the other system discarded the message, meaning you don't know if the message was processed
	// UNRELIABLE_SEQUENCED_WITH_ACK_RECEIPT,

	/// Same as RELIABLE. The user will also get ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED after the message is delivered when calling RakPeerInterface::Receive(). ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED is returned when the message arrives, not necessarily the order when it was sent. Bytes 1-4 will contain the number returned from the Send() function. On disconnect or shutdown, all messages not previously acked should be considered lost. This does not return ID_SND_RECEIPT_LOSS.
	RELIABLE_WITH_ACK_RECEIPT,

	/// Same as RELIABLE_ORDERED_ACK_RECEIPT. The user will also get ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED after the message is delivered when calling RakPeerInterface::Receive(). ID_SND_RECEIPT_ACKED is returned when the message arrives, not necessarily the order when it was sent. Bytes 1-4 will contain the number returned from the Send() function. On disconnect or shutdown, all messages not previously acked should be considered lost. This does not return ID_SND_RECEIPT_LOSS.
